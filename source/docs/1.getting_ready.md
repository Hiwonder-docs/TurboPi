## 1.3 Introduction to Raspberry Pi 5

Raspberry Pi, RPi or RasPi for short, is a credit card-sized computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in the UK. It was created with the vision of helping children around the world learn programming and understand how computers work. Raspberry Pi can be connected to a keyboard, mouse, and Ethernet cable. It includes both analog video output and HDMI high-definition video output, making it accessible to users of all ages. It's an excellent tool for learning programming languages like Python. In addition to learning, Raspberry Pi can handle many of the tasks a desktop computer can do, such as web browsing, playing HD videos, working with spreadsheets, word processing, and even gaming! 

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/6.1/image2.png" />

<p style="text-align:center">Raspberry Pi Logo</p>

**1.3.1 Overview of Raspberry Pi 5**

Raspberry Pi 5 features a 64-bit quad-core Cortex A76 processor with 2.4 GHz operating frequency. Compared to the Raspberry Pi 4, the CPU performance has increased by 2 to 3 times. Apart from the significant improvement in graphics performance with the 800MHz VideoCore VII GPU, it also supports dual 4Kp60 display output via HDMI, and advanced camera through restructuring Raspberry Pi Image Signal Processor. It provides consumers with a smooth desktop experience and opens up new applications for industrial customers.

This is the first full-sized Raspberry Pi computer, utilizing chips built internally by Raspberry Pi. RP1 provides the majority of the I/O functions for Raspberry Pi 5 and achieves a significant leap in peripheral performance and functionality. The total USB bandwidth has more than doubled, thus speeding up the transfer rate to external UAS drives and other high-speed peripherals. The dedicated dual-channel 1Gbps MIPI camera and display interface on earlier models have been replaced by a pair of quad-channel 1.5Gbps MIPI transceivers, tripling the total bandwidth and supporting a maximum of two cameras or displays in any combination. By supporting SDR104 high-speed mode, the peak performance of the SD card is doubled. This platform introduces a single-channel PCI Express 2.0 interface for the first time, providing support for high-bandwidth peripherals.

## 1.6 Charging and Power-On Status Description

:::{Note}

Before powering on, please make sure the robot is fully assembled according to the instructions in  [1.5 Assembly](#anchor_1_5)

:::

**1.6.1 Battery Charging and Installation**

Due to transportation restrictions, the battery is not fully charged upon delivery. It is recommended to fully charge the battery before the first use. Follow the steps below:

(1) Put two 18650 batteries into the battery charger. Note: Don't invert battery terminals! Then connect battery charger and charger head of 5V 3A (It is not included, and you need to use your own charger head.) Lastly, plug the charger head into power outlet.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/3.1/image2.png" />

(2) The charger's indicator light is green when unplugged, and turns red when charging. It takes approximately 3 hours to fully charge the batteries and the light turns green again. Unplug the charger promptly after charging. Do not leave it connected for an extended period.

**1.6.2 Installing the Battery**

(1) Before installing, make sure the switch on the battery case is set to **"OFF".**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/3.1/image3.png" />

(2) Insert the fully charged batteries into the battery case and close the battery cover. Caution: Do not reverse the battery polarity!

**1.6.3 Check Whether Camera is Connected**

Before powering on, ensure the camera's USB cable is securely connected. It can be plugged into any of the four USB ports on the Raspberry Pi controller.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/3.1/image4.png" />

**1.6.4 Start TurboPi**

(1) Turn on battery case. Then start TurboPi. (The switch is on Raspberry Pi expansion board.) At this time, LED1 and LED 2 on Raspberry Pi keep on. Then LED2 flickers every 1s, pan tilt recovers initial posture and buzzer emits a beep, which means that TurboPi boots up successfully. 

:::{Note}

* The Raspberry Pi is a computer and requires some time to boot. Startup takes around 30 seconds, so please be patient. 
* LED1 is the power indicator. It lights up when powered and stays on during operation. If it dims, it means the battery is low and needs to be recharged.
* LED2 is the communication indicator. By default, the device uses AP (Access Point) mode, where LED2 blinks once every second after boot-up. If switched to LAN mode, LED2 will stay on constantly. For more details, refer to"[**2.Quick User Experience\2.1 APP Installation and Connection**](2.quick_user_experience.md#app-installation-and-connection)".

* If both LED1 and LED2 are dim and remain constantly on, the battery is low and needs recharging.

  :::

(2) Upon successful startup, the device will automatically generate a Wi-Fi hotspot beginning with "**HW**" in AP mode.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/3.1/image5.jpeg"  class="common_img" />

**1.6.5 Run Self-detection Program**

After robot starts, you can press KEY1 to run self-detection program to detect servos and motors so as to ensure wiring is correct. 
If robot cannot move as below after self-detection program runs, you need to rewire according to "[**Read First\1.5 Assembly**](#anchor_1_5)".

(1) Press KEY1 on expansion board to start self-detection.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/3.1/image6.png" />

(2) Servos and motors move in the order as pictured.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/3.1/image7.png" />

**1.6.6 Check Battery Level**

There are two ways to check battery level. 

**Method 1: Low Voltage Alarm**

The robot has a low voltage alert. When the voltage drops below 7.1V, the buzzer will emit a continuous beeping sound.

If the LED on the Raspberry Pi expansion board shows a weak blue light, the battery is too low to keep the device running and needs to be recharged immediately.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/3.1/image6.png" />

**Method 2: App Interface**

The real-time battery level is displayed on the video feedback screen in the app. When the voltage drops below 7.1V, a low battery warning is shown and the battery must be recharged promptly. For more on the app experience, see  "[**Play Modes in the App**](2.quick_user_experience.md#play-modes-in-the-app)" 

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/3.1/image8.jpeg" />

Having completed above operations, calibrate deviation of pan tilt according to "[ **Read First\1.9 Adjust Pan-Tilt**](#anchor_5)". Please don't skip this step.

<p id="anchor_1_7"></p>

## 1.8 Introduction to Docker Container and How to Access

**1.8.1 Introduction to Docker**

Docker is an open-source platform and tool that helps you package, distribute, and run applications in containers. A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Docker allows developers to bundle applications with their dependencies—not just the app itself—so they can be deployed quickly and consistently across different environments.

Technically, Docker leverages Linux containerization technology to ensure higher isolation between applications. This enables multiple containers to run on the same physical machine while remaining completely independent from each other.

In summary, Docker can be understood as a tool that improves application portability and ease of management, greatly simplifying software development and deployment.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image2.jpeg" />

<p style="text-align:center">Docker's Logo</p>

For further learning about Docker, you may refer to the relevant lessons in "**Docker Container Tutorial**" within the course materials, or visit official Docker resources and websites for more information.

**1.8.2  Common Docker Commands**

All functionalities and programs of this product are designed to run inside Docker containers. To help users get started quickly, the following section introduces commonly used Docker commands.

(1) Power on the device. Use the VNC Remote Desktop Tool to connect to the robot system via remote desktop under the directory of [1.7 Remote Desktop Installation and Connection](#anchor_1_7).

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image3.jpeg" />

(2) Click the top-left desktop icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image4.png" /> to open the Terminator ROS2 terminal.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image5.jpeg" />

This is the command-line interface of the Raspberry Pi.

(3) Double-click the "**Tool**" icon <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image6.png" /> to launch the robot system configuration tool, then click "**Execute**".

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image7.png" />

(4) and select the appropriate language model in the pop-up interface. This configuration requires setting up the large model according to the selected language version.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image8.png" />

(5) After selection, click **Save \> Apply \> Exit** to activate the new configuration.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image9.png" />

(6) When the buzzer beeps once, it means the robot type has been successfully switched. Open the terminal again <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image10.png" /> to view the ROS2 environment.

<p id="anchor_1_8_2_2"></p>

* **View Containers**

The system is preset to enter the container at startup. The following is for your understanding.

Command syntax: docker ps \[OPTIONS\]

Common options:

① -a: Lists all containers, including running and exited

② -l: Shows the most recently created container

③ -n=?: Shows the most recent n containers

④ -q: Quiet mode, only shows container IDs

This command displays all running and previously run containers. Output includes the container ID, image name, creation time, and current status.

```
docker ps -a
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image11.jpeg" />

* **Enter a Container**

**The system is preset to enter the container at startup. The following is for your understanding.**

Use the container ID obtained in section "[**1.8.2  Common Docker Commands -> View Containers**](#anchor_1_8_2_2)" to enter the container that contains the functional programs.

You can shorten the container ID as long as it remains unique.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image12.png" />

* **Exit a Container**

There are two ways to exit:

(1) Enter the command directly in the terminal and press Enter — this will stop the container and exit.

```
exit
```

(2) Use the shortcut key combination **Ctrl + P + Q** — this will detach from the container without stopping it. You can then enter a command in the terminal to check the running containers.

```
docker ps
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/8.1/media/image14.jpeg" />

<p id="anchor_5"></p>

## 1.9 Adjust Pan-Tilt

 If servo main shaft or other operations deviates during assembling TurboPi, you need to calibrate deviation. The deviation is divided into two cases: small deviation and large deviation. Depending on the situation, the debugging methods also vary. See below to check how to calibrate deviation under two cases.

**1.9.1 Preparation**

(1) Start TurboPi according to "**[1.6 Charging and Power-On Status Description](#anchor_1_6)**"

(2) Connect to TurboPi system desktop through VNC according to the instruction in "**[1.7 Remote Desktop Installation and Connection](#anchor_1_7)**"

**1.9.2  Judge the Deviation Degree**

(1) Servos automatically reset as TurboPi starts. If these three parts of robot are parallel, you don't need to calibrate deviation and skip following operations.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image2.png" />

(2) If the angle between servo and center line is less than 13°, you can directly adjust the deviation through PC software since the deviation is minor. For detailed instruction, please refer to "[**1.9.3 Calibrate Minor Deviation**](#anchor_1_9_3)".

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image3.png" />

(3) If the angle between servo and center line is greater than 13°, you cannot directly adjust the deviation through PC software since the deviation is large. For detailed instruction, please refer to "[**1.9.4 Calibrate Large Deviation**](#anchor_1_9_4)".

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image4.png" />

<p id="anchor_1_9_3"></p>

**1.9.3 Calibrate Minor Deviation**

For minor deviation, you can directly drag slider on PC software framed on the picture below to adjust deviation. Open <img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image5.png"/> and then select "**Execute**" to open PC software.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image6.png" />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image7.png" />

(1) Drag servo2 slider to adjust NO.2 servo so as to make U-shaped bracket of TurboPi parallel with the base bracket.

:::{Note}
 adjustment range is from 1350 to 1650. If they are still not parallel when you adjust the slider within this range, it means that the deviation is great, so you need to calibrate the deviation according to "[**1.9.4 Calibrate Large Deviation**](#anchor_1_9_4)".
:::

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image8.png" />

(2) Click "**Save**" to save the deviation value.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image9.png" />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image10.png" />

<p id="anchor_1_9_4"></p>

**1.9.4 Calibrate Large Deviation**

Before calibrating large deviation, you need to remove the servo from pan tilt. Next, center the servo, and then calibrate the deviation.

(1) Servos automatically reset as TurboPi starts. Obviously, NO.2 servo has deviation. Angle between servo and center line is greater than 13°. 

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image11.png" />

(2) Turn off TurboPi. Never operate when TurboPi is turned on.

(3) Remove screw on the main shaft of NO.2 servo. 

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image12.png" />

(4) Slightly pull out the U-shaped bracket.

<img class="common_img" style="width: 830px;" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image13.png" />

(5) Turn on robot. (The switch is on Raspberry Pi) Robot emits a beep when it starts. At this time, servos are automatically centered. After servos are centered, turn off robot.

(6) Install U-shaped bracket on NO.2 servo as pictured. 

:::{Note}

Don't move servo when installing the bracket. If you move the servo accidentally, please repeat Step 5.

:::

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/5.1/image10.png" />

(7) Put the screw back. Then make fine adjustment according to "[**1.9.3 Calibrate Minor Deviation**](#anchor_1_9_3)".
