### 2.1 Brief Introduction of Raspberry Pi 5

Raspberry Pi 5 features a 64-bit quad-core Cortex A76 processor with 2.4 GHz operating frequency. Compared to the Raspberry Pi 4, the CPU performance has increased by 2 to 3 times. Apart from the significant improvement in graphics performance with the 800MHz VideoCore VII GPU, it also supports dual 4Kp60 display output via HDMI, and advanced camera through restructuring Raspberry Pi Image Signal Processor. It provides consumers with a smooth desktop experience and opens up new applications for industrial customers.

This is the first full-sized Raspberry Pi computer, utilizing chips built internally by Raspberry Pi. RP1 provides the majority of the I/O functions for Raspberry Pi 5 and achieves a significant leap in peripheral performance and functionality. The total USB bandwidth has more than doubled, thus speeding up the transfer rate to external UAS drives and other high-speed peripherals. The dedicated dual-channel 1Gbps MIPI camera and display interface on earlier models have been replaced by a pair of quad-channel 1.5Gbps MIPI transceivers, tripling the total bandwidth and supporting a maximum of two cameras or displays in any combination. By supporting SDR104 high-speed mode, the peak performance of the SD card is doubled. This platform introduces a single-channel PCI Express 2.0 interface for the first time, providing support for high-bandwidth peripherals.

## 5. Charging and Power-On Status Description

:::{Note}

please assemble robot according to[Getting Ready\4.Assembly]()

:::

### 5.1 Charge Battery

For delivery safety, battery is not fully charged. Before operating robot, please fully charge the battery.

(1) Put two 18650 batteries into the battery charger. Note: Don't invert battery terminals! Then connect battery charger and charger head of 5V 3A (It is not included, and you need to use your own charger head.) Lastly, plug the charger head into power outlet.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/3.1/image2.png"   />

(2) It takes about 5 hours to fully charge the battery. Indicator is green when the battery charger is not plugged into power outlet. It turns red when charging, and turns green once fully charged. Remember to unplug the charger in time. Never leave the battery charging all the time!

### 5.2 Install Battery

(1) Turn off the battery case first. 

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/3.1/image3.png"   />

(2) Put the battery fully charged into the battery case. Don't invert battery terminal!

### 5.3 Check Whether Camera is Connected

Check whether the camera cable is secure before starting robot. (Camera cable should be connected to any USB port on Raspberry Pi.)

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/3.1/image4.png"  />

### 5.4 Start TurboPi

(1) Turn on battery case. Then start TurboPi. (The switch is on Raspberry Pi expansion board.) At this time, LED1 and LED 2 on Raspberry Pi keep on. Then LED2 flickers every 1s, pan tilt recovers initial posture and buzzer emits a beep, which means that TurboPi boots up successfully. 

:::{Note}

① LED1 is power indicator. When robot is turned on, LED1 keeps on. If it dims, it means that the battery level is low and you need to charge in time. 

② LED2 is communication indicator. The network connection mode defaults to direct connection mode. After robot boots up, LED2 flickers every 1s. Under LAN mode, LED2 keeps on. For how to set network connection mode, please refer to "[Quick User Experience\1.APP Installation and Connection](https://docs.hiwonder.com/projects/TurboPi/en/latest/docs/2.quick_user_experience.html#app)".

③ If LED and LED2 keep on but dim when robot is working, it means that the battery level is low and you need to charge in time. 

:::

(2) Robot defaults to AP direct connection mode. It generates a WiFi starting with HW once booting up.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/3.1/image5.jpeg"  class="common_img"  />

### 5.5 Run Self-detection Program

After robot starts, you can press KEY1 to run self-detection program to detect servos and motors so as to ensure wiring is correct.

### 5.6 Check Battery Level

There are two ways to check battery level. 

**Method 1: infer battery level based on LED.**

When LED on Raspberry Pi dims, it means battery level is low, and you need to charge robot as soon as possible.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/3.1/image6.png"   />

**Method 2: check it on the APP**

The app's feedback screen will directly display the real-time battery level. When the battery voltage is below 7V, charge the battery in time. You can go to "[App Control]()" to experience app control.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/3.1/image8.jpeg"   />

Having completed above operations, calibrate deviation of pan tilt according to "[ Getting Ready\7.Adjust Pan-Tilt](#anchor_5)". Please don't skip this step.

## 8. Adjust Pan-Tilt

 If servo main shaft or other operations deviates during assembling TurboPi, you need to calibrate deviation. The deviation is divided into two cases: small deviation and large deviation. Depending on the situation, the debugging methods also vary. See below to check how to calibrate deviation under two cases.

### 8.1 **Preparation**

(1) Start TurboPi according to "**[ Getting Ready\5. Charging and Power-On Status Description](#anchor_3)**"

(2) Connect to TurboPi system desktop through VNC according to the instruction in "**[Getting Ready\6. Remote Desktop Installation and Connection](#anchor_4)**"

### 8.2  Judge the Deviation Degree

(1) Servos automatically reset as TurboPi starts. If these three parts of robot are parallel, you don't need to calibrate deviation and skip following operations.

(2) If the angle between servo and center line is less than 13°, you can directly adjust the deviation through PC software since the deviation is minor. For detailed instruction, please refer to "[8.3 Calibrate Minor Deviation](#anchro_5_3)".

(3) If the angle between servo and center line is greater than 13°, you cannot directly adjust the deviation through PC software since the deviation is large. For detailed instruction, please refer to "[8.4 Calibrate Large Deviation](#anchro_5_4)".

### 8.3 Calibrate Minor Deviation

For minor deviation, you can directly drag slider on PC software framed on the picture below to adjust deviation. Open<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/5.1/image5.png"   />and then select "Execute" to open PC software.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/5.1/image7.png"  />

(1) Drag servo2 slider to adjust NO.2 servo so as to make U-shaped bracket of TurboPi parallel with the base bracket.

:::{Note}
 adjustment range is from 1350 to 1650. If they are still not parallel when you adjust the slider within this range, it means that the deviation is great, so you need to calibrate the deviation according to "[8.4 Calibrate Large Deviation](#anchro_5_4)".

### 8.4 Calibrate Large Deviation

Before calibrating large deviation, you need to remove the servo from pan tilt. Next, center the servo, and then calibrate the deviation.

(1) Servos automatically reset as TurboPi starts. Obviously, NO.2 servo has deviation. Angle between servo and center line is greater than 13°. 

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/5.1/image11.png"   />

(2) Turn off TurboPi. Never operate when TurboPi is turned on.

(3) Remove screw on the main shaft of NO.2 servo.

(4) Slightly pull out the U-shaped bracket.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/5.1/image13.png"   />

(5) Turn on robot. (The switch is on Raspberry Pi) Robot emits a beep when it starts. At this time, servos are automatically centered. After servos are centered, turn off robot.。

(6) Install U-shaped bracket on NO.2 servo as pictured. Note: don't move servo when installing the bracket. If you move the servo accidentally, please repeat Step 5.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/5.1/image10.png"   />

(7) Put the screw back. Then make fine adjustment according to "[8.3 Calibrate Minor Deviation](#anchro_5_3)".
