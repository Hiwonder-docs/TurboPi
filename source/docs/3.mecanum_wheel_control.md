# 3. Mecanum Wheel Robot Basic Lesson

## 3.1 Introduction to Mecanum Wheel Movement

### 3.1.1 Overview

The TurboPi chassis is equipped with Mecanum wheels, which allow for omnidirectional movement. Depending on the direction of the rollers set at a 45° angle, Mecanum wheels can be classified into two mirror-image types: Type A and Type B, as shown in the diagram below.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image2.png" style="width:600px;" />

Mecanum wheels offer excellent maneuverability, stability, and omnidirectional mobility. By using four wheels in a specific configuration, TurboPi is capable of moving freely in any direction.

### 3.1.2 Working Principle

* **Hardware Structure**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image3.png" style="width:500px;" />

A Mecanum wheel consists of a main wheel hub and multiple rollers mounted around the hub. The rollers are angled at 45 degrees relative to the axis of the hub. Typically, Mecanum wheels are used in sets of four, two left-handed wheels (Type A) and two right-handed wheels (Type B), which are arranged symmetrically.

There are several common configurations, such as AAAA, BBBB, AABB, ABAB, BABA, etc. However, not all configurations support full-range movement functions like forward/backward motion, rotation, and lateral movement. The TurboPi uses the ABAB configuration, which enables true omnidirectional movement.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image4.png"   />

* **Physical Characteristics**

The motion of a Mecanum wheel robot is determined by the direction and speed of each individual wheel. The forces generated by each wheel combine to produce a resultant force vector, allowing the robot to move freely in any desired direction without changing the orientation of the wheels.

Because of the angled rollers distributed around the edge of the wheel, lateral movement is also possible. The rollers follow a unique path. When the wheel rotates around its central axis, the roller surfaces form a cylindrical envelope, allowing the robot to roll continuously in a given direction.

In kinematic analysis, the motion of Mecanum wheels can be described using a kinematic model. This includes several key parameters:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image5.jpeg"   />

(1) V<sub>x</sub>: Linear velocity of the chassis along the X-axis, typically the forward/backward direction.

(2) V<sub>y</sub>: Linear velocity of the chassis along the Y-axis, typically the left/right or lateral direction.

(3) V<sub>ω</sub>: Angular velocity of the chassis, the rotation speed around its own center.

(4) V<sub>A</sub>、V<sub>B</sub>、V<sub>C</sub>、V<sub>D</sub>: Real-time rotational speeds of the four individual wheels.

For example, the motion of the front-right wheel (Wheel B) on a 2D plane can be decomposed into:

(1) VBx: Linear velocity of the chassis along the X-axis, typically the forward/backward direction.

(2) VBy: Linear velocity of the chassis along the Y-axis, typically the left/right or lateral direction.

(3) L: The distance between the centers of the left and right wheels.

(4) H: The distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels.

(5) θ<sub>ω</sub>: The angle between the robot's center of mass and the front-right wheel, typically 45°.

Based on these parameters, we can perform kinematic analysis of the Mecanum wheel chassis to determine how wheel speeds contribute to the overall movement of the robot in any direction.

### 3.1.3 Kinematic Analysis and Formula Derivation (Optional Reading)

To simplify the kinematic model, we make the following two idealized assumptions:

① The Mecanum wheels do not slip on the ground, and the ground provides sufficient friction.

② The four wheels are positioned at the corners of a rectangle or square, and all wheels are parallel to their corresponding axes.

In this model, the robot's rigid body movement is decomposed into three linear components: translation along the X-axis, translation along the Y-axis, and rotation around the Z-axis. By calculating the individual wheel speeds required for these three simple motions, we can combine them to compute the required rotational speed for each wheel during compound motion of simultaneous translation and rotation.

V<sub>A</sub>,V<sub>B</sub>,V<sub>C</sub>, and V<sub>D</sub> represent the rotational speeds of wheels A, B, C, and D, respectively, which correspond to the motor speeds. V<sub>X</sub> is the robot's translational velocity along the X-axis, V<sub>y</sub> is the translational velocity along the Y-axis, and V<sub>ω</sub> is the angular velocity of the chassis around the Z-axis. <img   src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image6.jpeg"   /> L represents half of the robot's wheelbase, and <img   src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image6.jpeg"    /> H represents half of the track width.

(1) When the robot moves along the X-axis, the speed component of each wheel can be calculated using the following formula:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image7.png"   />

V<sub>A</sub>,V<sub>B</sub>,V<sub>C</sub>, and V<sub>D</sub> are the real-time speeds of the four Mecanum wheels in the X-axis direction.

(2) When the robot moves along the Y-axis, the speed component of each wheel can be calculated using the following formula:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image8.png"   />

V<sub>y</sub> is the speed of the Mecanum wheels in the Y-axis direction.

(3) When the robot rotates around the Z-axis, the speed component of each wheel can be calculated using the following formula:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image9.png"   />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image9.png"   />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image10.jpeg"   />Vω is the angular velocity of the Mecanum chassis, which is the rotation speed around its own center).

(4) By combining the velocities along the X, Y, and Z axes, the rotational speed required for each of the four wheels can be derived according to the robot's overall motion state.

## 3.2 Moving Forward

###  3.2.1 Brief Overview of Operation

Based on the characteristics of Mecanum wheels, all four wheels must rotate forward simultaneously for the robot car to move straight ahead, as shown in the force analysis diagram below.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_2/image2.png"   />

According to principles of physics and kinematics, forces of equal magnitude but opposite directions cancel each other out.

Assuming the A and B wheels rotate forward at the same speed, the rightward forces generated by wheels A1 and A2 will cancel out the leftward forces generated by wheels B1 and B2. This leaves only the forward-directed force components from A1, A2, B1, and B2.

The net force vector points forward. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion (F = ma), this forward force produces forward acceleration, resulting in a net velocity V directed forward.

        self.mecanum_pub = self.create_publisher(Twist, 'cmd_vel', 1)  # Chassis Control （底盘控制）
        self.timer = self.create_timer(1.0, self.timer_callback)

    def timer_callback(self):    
        twist = Twist()
        twist.linear.x = 0.5  # Set Linear Velocity （设置线速度）
        self.mecanum_pub.publish(twist)
        self.get_logger().info(f"Published twist: {twist.linear.x}")
        
    def stop(self, signum, frame):
        self.mecanum_pub.publish(Twist())
        rclpy.shutdown()

def main():
    rclpy.init()  
    node = CarMoveDemo()
    try:
        rclpy.spin(node)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:

    finally:
        node.destroy_node()
        rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The motor is controlled using the function self.create_publisher(Twist, 'cmd_vel', 1)**.** The definition of parameter in the code twist.linear.x = 0.9:

The value 0.9 represents the linear velocity of the motor, with a valid range of -1 to 1. A negative value causes the motor to rotate in reverse. A value between 0 and 1 makes the robot's wheels move forward—the greater the value, the faster the wheels spin. It is recommended to set the parameter above 0.35 for noticeable wheel movement. A value between -1 and 0 makes the wheels move in reverse—the smaller the value, the faster the reverse speed. It is recommended to set the parameter below -0.35 for noticeable wheel movement.

###  3.2.5 Feature Extensions

By default, the program sets the forward speed to 0.5. We can try adjusting the robot's speed—here, we'll change the speed to 0.9. The specific steps are as follows:

(1) Click the terminal icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_2/image4.png"  /> in the upper-left corner of the system desktop to open a command-line window.

(3) Enter the command to open the program file and press Enter.

```
vim car_forward_demo.py
```

(4) Locate the section of code you want to modify, then press the "**i**" key on the keyboard. When a prompt appears in the bottom-left corner, you've entered editing mode.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_2/image10.png"  />

(5) In the twist.linear.x function, the parameter represents the motor's linear velocity. Here, we'll change it to 0.9. After making the change, press the "**Esc**" key, then type the command below and press Enter to save and exit the program.

```
:wq
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_2/image11.png"  />

:::{Note}

The valid speed range is -1~1. A positive value causes the motor to rotate forward; a negative value causes it to rotate in reverse. If set to a negative value, the movement direction of the robot may change. It is recommended to set the value within the range of 0~1.

(6) After completing the modification, you can follow the instructions in the previous section to run the program again and observe the effect.

## 3.3 Turning

###  3.3.1 Brief Overview of Operation

According to the characteristics of Mecanum wheels, when the wheels on the left side of the robot rotate in reverse and the wheels on the right side rotate forward, the robot will rotate counterclockwise on the spot. Conversely, when the left wheels rotate forward and the right wheels rotate in reverse, the robot will rotate clockwise on the spot.

The force analysis diagrams for the two cases are as follows:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image2.png"   />

(1) When the left wheels rotate in reverse and the right wheels rotate forward:

The left wheels push backward, and the right wheels pull forward, which causes the entire robot to rotate counterclockwise.

(2) When the left wheels rotate forward and the right wheels rotate in reverse:

The left wheels pull forward, and the right wheels push backward, which causes the entire robot to rotate clockwise.

The unique properties of Mecanum wheels determine that when the rotation directions of the left and right wheels are opposite, a rotational torque is generated, causing the robot to spin in place. The difference in rotation direction between the left and right wheels generates a twisting torque, making the robot rotate around its central axis. By controlling the rotation speed and direction of the left and right wheels, the robot can perform on-the-spot rotation.

The motor is controlled using the function self.twist.angular.z. For example, in the line self.twist.angular.z = -5.0, the parameter -5.0 represents the angular velocity of the robot turning clockwise. The larger the value, the faster the angular velocity. The range for clockwise rotation is from -10 to 0.

###  3.3.5 Feature Extensions

By default, the program sets the turning angular velocity to 5.0. You can try adjusting the rotation speed of the robot. Here, we will change the counterclockwise rotation speed to 6.0. The specific modification steps are as follows:

(1) Click the icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image4.jpeg"   /> in the upper-left corner of the desktop to enter the terminal.

(2) Enter the command to switch to the directory where the demo program is located, then press Enter.

(5) In the self.twist.angular.z function, the parameter represents the angular velocity of the robot's turning motion. A positive value means counterclockwise rotation, and a negative value means clockwise rotation. The default value is 5.0, now changing it to 6.0.

```

## 3.4 Forward, Backward, and Sideways Movement

### 3.4.1 Brief Overview of Operation

According to the characteristics of Mecanum wheels, when all wheels rotate forward, the robot moves forward, when all wheels rotate backward, the robot moves backward. When all A wheels rotate backward and B wheels rotate forward, the robot strafes to the left, when all B wheels rotate backward and A wheels rotate forward, the robot strafes to the right. The force analysis diagrams for forward, backward, and sideways movement are as follows:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image2.png"   />

According to the principles of physics and kinematics, equal and opposite forces cancel each other out. Assuming the A and B wheels rotate forward at the same speed, the rightward force generated by the A wheels and the leftward force generated by the B wheels cancel each other out. The resulting force points forward. Based on Newton's second law of motion (F = ma), the acceleration is directed forward, and therefore the resulting velocity "**Vₑ**" also points forward. The velocity decomposition for other directions is derived using the same logic.

**(1) Forward and Backward Movement:**

When all wheels rotate forward, the robot moves forward. When all wheels rotate backward, the robot moves backward. Because the thrust directions of all four wheels are aligned, driving the robot to move forward or backward.

**(2) Leftward Movement:**

When the two left wheels rotate backward and the two right wheels rotate forward, the left wheels push backward and the right wheels pull forward. This generates a leftward force that causes the robot to strafe left.

**(3) Rightward Movement:**

When the two right wheels rotate backward and the two left wheels rotate forward, the right wheels push backward and the left wheels pull forward. This generates a rightward force that causes the robot to strafe right.

## 3.5 Diagonal Movement

###  3.5.1 Brief Overview of Operation

According to the characteristics of Mecanum wheels, when A wheels remain stationary and B wheels rotate forward, the robot moves diagonally forward to the left. When B wheels rotate in reverse, the robot moves diagonally backward to the right. When B wheels remain stationary and A wheels rotate forward, the robot moves diagonally forward to the right. When A wheels rotate in reverse, the robot moves diagonally backward to the left. The force analysis diagram for the robot's diagonal movement is as follows:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_5/image2.png"   />

(1) When A wheels are stationary and B wheels rotate forward:

The B wheels push forward while the A wheels remain still, which generates a torque toward the front-left direction, causing the robot to move diagonally forward-left.

(2) When B wheels are stationary and A wheels rotate forward:

The A wheels pull forward while the B wheels remain still, which generates a torque toward the front-right direction, causing the robot to move diagonally forward-right.

(3) When A wheels are stationary and B wheels rotate in reverse:

The B wheels pull backward while the A wheels remain still, which generates a torque toward the back-right direction, causing the robot to move diagonally backward-right.

(4) When B wheels are stationary and A wheels rotate in reverse:

The A wheels push backward while the B wheels remain still, which generates a torque toward the back-left direction, causing the robot to move diagonally backward-left.

## 3.6 Drifting Motion

###  3.6.1 Brief Overview of Operation

According to the characteristics of Mecanum wheels, when the front wheels remain stationary and the rear A wheel rotates forward while the B wheel rotates backward, the robot drifts counterclockwise. When the rear B wheel rotates forward and the A wheel rotates backward, the robot drifts clockwise.

(1) When the front wheels remain stationary, and the rear A wheel rotates forward while the B wheel rotates backward:

The A wheel pulls forward, and the B wheel pushes backward, generating a counterclockwise torque, causing the robot to drift counterclockwise.

(2) When the front wheels remain stationary, and the rear B wheel rotates forward while the A wheel rotates backward:

The B wheel pulls forward, and the A wheel pushes backward, generating a clockwise torque, causing the robot to drift clockwise.

The unique properties of Mecanum wheels determine that when the rotation directions of the left and right wheels are opposite, a rotational torque is generated, causing the robot to drift in place. With only the rear wheels rotating and the front wheels stationary, a torsional torque is produced, causing the robot to rotate around its central axis and drift. By controlling the speed and direction of the rear wheels, the drifting motion of the robot can be achieved.

The force analysis diagram for the robot's drifting motion is as follows:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_6/image2.png"   />

According to physical kinematics, forces of equal magnitude and opposite direction cancel each other out. Take counterclockwise drifting as an example: if the rear A and B wheels rotate at the same speed, the upward force component from the A wheels and the downward force component from the B wheels cancel each other, resulting in a net force to the right.

According to Newton's Second Law of Motion (F = ma), the direction of acceleration is to the right, and thus the resulting velocity is also directed to the right. Since the front wheels do not move, the robot drifts in that direction. The same logic applies to clockwise drifting.
