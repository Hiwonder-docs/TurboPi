# 3. Motion Control Course

## 1. Introduction to Mecanum Wheel Car

### 1.1 Preface

TurboPi adopts mecanum wheels which move in all direction. According to direction of roller, wheels can be divided into wheel A and wheel B which are in mirror-image relationship with each other as pictured.

<img class="half_img" src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/1.1/image1.png"  />

It features 360° movement, flexibility and stability. The combination of four mecanum wheels enables TurboPi to move more flexibly and achieve 360° movement.

### 1.2 Working Principle

**1.2.1 Mecanum Wheel Hardware Structure**

<img class="half_img" src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/1.1/image2.png"  />

Mecanum wheel is composed of rollers and axles. Axle serves as main bracket of the whole wheel, and rollers are attached to the axle. The axel axis is at a 45-degree angle to the roller axis. In general, mecanum wheels work in a group of four, including two left wheels and two right wheels. A wheel and B wheel are symmetrical.
There are several combination of four mecanum wheels, such as AAAA, BBBB, AABB, ABAB, BABA. Not all combinations of wheels enable TurboPi to go forward, backward, and move left and right, etc. The combination of TurboPi's wheels are ABAB, which can realize omnidirectional movement.

<img class="half_img" src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/1.1/image3.png"   />

**1.2.2 Mecanum Wheel Physical Characteristics**

The omnidirectional motion of the vehicle is achieved as the vector summation of propelling forces on the ground-engaging rollers can be in any direction by adjusting the wheel rotation direction and torque magnitude of the four wheels.
Due to the rollers at its rim oriented at an certain angle to the wheel circumference, the mecanum wheels can slip in sideways direction. The generatrix of small rollers are special. When the mecanum wheel revolves around its fixed axle, the envelope of each small roller is a cylindrical surface so that the wheel can roll forward continuously.
When conducting kinematic analysis, we can consider the kinematic model of mecanum wheels, which includes the following parameters:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/1.1/image4.png"  />

(1) Vx: the velocity of the mecanum wheel in the X-axis forward/backward direction.

(2) Vy: the velocity of the mecanum wheel in the X-axis left/right direction.

(3) Vω: the angular velocity of the mecanum wheelbase (i.e., the speed at which the base rotates around its own center).

(4) VA、VB、VC、VD： the real-time speed of the four mecanum wheels.
The motion of the right front wheel in the plane can be decomposed into:

(5) VBx：the velocity of the mecanum wheel in the X-axis forward/backward direction.

(6) VBy：the velocity of the mecanum wheel in the X-axis left/right direction.

(7) L: represents the distance between the centers of the left and right wheels.

(8) H: represents the distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels.

(9) θω：the angle formed between the chassis center of gravity and the center of the right front wheel is 45°.

The kinematics of mecanum wheel baseboard can be analyzed base on these parameters.

### 1.3 Kinematics Analysis Formula Calculation

To simplify the mathematical module of kinematics, there are two ideal assumptions:

(1) The omni-directional wheel does not slip on the ground, while there is sufficient friction force between the ground and the wheel.

(2) The four wheels are distributed at the four corners of a rectangle or square, with the wheels parallel to each other.

The rigid body motion of the car is decomposed into three components here. Calculate the velocities of the four wheels when the output mecanum wheelbase translates along the X+, Y+, and Z+ directions. When these three simple motions are combined, you can use the combined formulas to calculate the speeds of the four wheels required for the composite motion of "translation + rotation". Then calculate the speeds of the four wheels required for the composite motion of "translation + rotation" by combining formulas when these three simple motions are combined.
VA, VB, VC, VD represent the speeds of wheels A, B, C, D respectively. That is also the speeds of motor. VX represents the speed of the car's translation along the X-axis. Vω represents the rotation speed of the car. L represents a half of the car's wheelbase L. H represents a half of the car's axle distance H. 

(3) When the robot translates along the X-axis, the velocity component of each wheel can be calculated using the following formula:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/1.1/image5.png"  />

VA、VB、VC、VD represent the real-time velocity of four mecanum wheels and the speed of mecanum wheel in the X-axis direction. 

(4) When the robot translates along the Y-axis, the velocity component of each wheel can be calculated using the following formula:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/1.1/image6.png"  />

Vy represents the speed of mecanum wheel in the Y-axis direction. 

(5) When the robot rotate along the Z-axis, the velocity component of each wheel can be calculated using the following formula:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/1.1/image7.png"  />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/1.1/image8.png"  />

 <img src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/1.1/image10.png"  />represents the angular velocity of mecanum wheel chassis. That is, the speed at which the base rotates around its own center.

(6) Combine the velocities in the X, Y, and Z directions, we can calculate the speeds of the four wheels based on the motion state of the car:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/1.1/image9.png"  />

## 2. Going Forward

### 2.1 Program Description 

According to characteristic of mecanum wheel, only when four wheels rotates forward, car can go forward. The analysis of force is as pictured. 

<img class="half_img" src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/2.1/image2.png"  />

Based on physical kinematics, when forces are equal and opposite to each other, they cancel each other out. Suppose wheel A and wheel B rotates at the same speed, a right force decomposed by wheel A and a left force decomposed by wheel B will cancel each other out, and then work together to make the zcar go forward. Based on Newton's second law (F=ma), if acceleration is forward, the final resultant force is also forward.

③ The third parameter "0.3" is yaw rate ranging from -2.0 to 2.0. 0 means that there is no angular velocity. When the value is positive number, car rotates clockwise. When it is negative number, car rotates counterclockwise. The greater the absolute value, the faster the car moves.

## 4. Move Forward, Backward, Left and Right

### 4.1 Program Description

According to characteristic of mecanum wheel, only when all wheels rotate forward, car goes forward. When all wheels rotate in reverse, car goes backward.

`Chassis.set_velocity` function is mainly used to control motors. It has three parameters. Take `chassis.set_velocity(50,45,0)` as example.

① The first parameter "50" is motor velocity ranging from -100 to 100 mm/s. When the value is negative number, motor rotates in reverse.

② The second parameter "45" is movement direction of car. It ranges from 0 to 360 degree. 90 degrees corresponds to front, 270 degree corresponds to back, 0 degree corresponds to right and 180 degree corresponds to left.

③ The third parameter "0" is yaw rate ranging from -2.0 to 2.0. 0 means that there is no angular velocity. When the value is positive number, car rotates clockwise. When it is negative number, car rotates counterclockwise. The greater the absolute value, the faster the car moves.

## 6. Drift

### 6.1 Program Description 

According to characteristic of mecanum wheel, when front two wheels don't move, hind A wheel rotates forward, hind B wheel rotates in reverse, car drifts counterclockwise. When front two wheels don't move, hind A wheel rotates in reverse, hind B wheel rotates forward, car drifts clockwise. The analysis of force is as pictured.

<img src="../_static/media/6.mecanum_wheel_control/6.1/image2.png"   />

Based on physical kinematics, when forces are equal and opposite to each other, they cancel each other out. Take drifting counterclockwise as example. Suppose wheel A and wheel B rotates at the same speed, a right force decomposed by wheel A and a left force decomposed by wheel B will cancel each other out, and the direction of the resultant is to right. 

Based on Newton's second law (F=ma), if acceleration is on right, the final resultant force is on right. When front wheels don't move and hind wheels move, TurboPi can drift.
