### 2.1.2 APP Connection

(1) Turn on the power switch on the Raspberry Pi expansion board to start TurboPi. For detailed steps, refer to: "[Read First\1.6 Charging and Power-On Status Explanation](https://docs.hiwonder.com/projects/TurboPi/en/latest/docs/1.getting_ready.html#charging-and-power-on-status-description)".

(2) Once TurboPi is successfully powered on, it will enter AP (Access Point) Mode and create a Wi-Fi hotspot beginning with **“HW”**.

* **Connection Modes Overview**

There are two connection modes, namely direct connection mode and LAN mode. APP functions are the same under these two modes.

(1) AP direct connection mode: TurboPi creates a hotspot that your phone can connect to directly, but no Internet access in this mode.

(2) STA LAN mode: TurboPi connects to a specified Wi-Fi network, and Internet access is available in this mode.

* **Connecting in AP Mode (Recommended First Step)**

When TurboPi powers on, it automatically enters AP mode and broadcasts a hotspot starting with “HW”.

(1) 1)Open the WonderPi app and select **"Standard" > "TurboPi"**.
